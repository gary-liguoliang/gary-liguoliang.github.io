It has been (almost) 6 months with my new role at a startup, I feel like that I’m running everyday and have no time to really think about the change. Is this kind of the “new stupid”? I hope it’s not, so I want to summarize and write it down the difference I learned.

## I managed to concentrate on my work and “run as fast as I can”

Well, I’m not saying that I didn’t concentrate on my work in my previous jobs. What I mean is I literally spend all my time on my work, not on meetings, emails, reports etc,. I used to spend a lot of time updating my manager on what I was doing and I needed to produce nice reports to my managers and sometimes, my manager’s managers. 

The bottleneck is not the infrastructure team or change management team, it’s just me. I have access to all products, I can deploy or destroy the production environment anytime, as long as I’m aware of what I’m doing. That’s cool!

## Delivery the product, not beautiful code

I used to work in a relatively bigger team with ~20 developers, splitted to 3 prods focused on different products. Most of the banks I worked for have “change-freeze” periods, mostly December will be one of them.  One day, my manager declared that we’ll do “platform enhancements” with a few nice diagrams.
However,  at the moment we all know that our product got few bugs like users cannot buy our products just because they don't have a valid date of birth in the CRM. 

I’m not very happy with it because the proviritoy is wrong to me,  if I receive 10% of each transaction, I’ll fix all the known production issues ASAP. but I’m not receiving any commision, neither does my manager. So we had a nice holiday season on refactoring.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think stakeholders will be happy if they really understand what we’re doing. 

Small startups are completely different,  with limited resources, we need to deliver a working product and get actual feedback from the markets. They might like the product because of a nice design, but definitely not because of my beautify code. 

## Size Does Matter

I don't really understand this when I first read it few years back, but now I do: 

> We're small and we like it that way. It gives us the ability to turn on a dime, deliver projects quickly, and dedicate extraordinary attention to your assignment.
> Our size allows us to work on projects we want to do rather than projects we have to do. Plus we can all fit in one cab if we squeeze.
