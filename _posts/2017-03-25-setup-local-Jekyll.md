If you're not a Ruby developer and you don't want to spend hours to setup your local Jekyll environment, you may consider to use a `Vagrant` to automate this setup. 

Just in case you have no knowledge to `Vagrant`: it's an open-source tool for "building complete development environments", we'll use it together with `VirtualBox` to start and config your local environment. 
you may view all the 'InfrastructureAsCode': https://github.com/guoliang-dev/jekyll-vagrant/blob/master/Vagrantfile
